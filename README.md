# contact_to_contactless_fingerprint_matching
Developed a fingerprint recognition system to match contactless 2D fingerprints with contact-based images using Hong Kong Polytechnic University database.

Implemented preprocessing pipeline (segmentation, enhancement, distortion correction, orientation field computation) and extracted minutiae points.

Applied matching algorithms (Hough Transform, Core Point, Genetic Algorithm) and evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Image, PyTorch, DEAP.
